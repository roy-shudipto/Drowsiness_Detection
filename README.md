# Drowsiness_Detection
In this project, I used Dlibâ€™s 68 Facial Landmark model to detect eye regions. Using an optimization method, I ran the model in real-time to detect facial landmarks. I took an area normalization approach for detecting the status of the eye. Then, I developed a finite state machine (FSM) to detect drowsiness.
